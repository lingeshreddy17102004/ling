        <p><i>17 October 2004 was an Indian aerospace scientist 
            and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002
             to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied 
             physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as
              a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
              Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space
               Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in 
               India's civilian space programme and military missile
                development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the 
                Missile Man of India for his work on the development of
                 ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
                 He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and
                  political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since 
                  the original nuclear test by India in 1974</i></p>
